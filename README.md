# Parallel-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Pi-Calculation

Objective: Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of Pi using OpenMP.
Description: Monte Carlo simulations use random sampling to estimate mathematical results. The goal is to estimate Pi by randomly generating points in a unit square and counting how many falls within a quarter circle.

Steps:
1.	Implement the Monte Carlo simulation for Pi calculation in serial.
2.	Use OpenMP to parallelize the generation and counting of random points.
3.	Ensure thread safety when updating shared variables.
4.	Run the simulation with different numbers of points and threads to analyse the performance.
5.	Compare the accuracy and performance of the parallel implementation with the serial one.

Key Learning Outcomes:

•	Random number generation and statistical estimation.

•	Managing shared variables and thread safety.

•	Performance tuning for parallel simulations.
